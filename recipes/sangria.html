            <li>Steps
                <ol>
                    <li>Add apples, oranges, and sugar to a large pitcher and muddle with a muddler or wooden spoon for 45 seconds.</li>
                    <li>Add orange juice and brandy and muddle again to combine for 30 seconds.</li>
                    <li>Add red wine and stir to incorporate, then taste and adjust flavor as needed. I added a bit more brandy, orange juice and brown sugar. Stir to combine.</li>
                    <li>Add ice and stir once more to chill. Serve as is, or with a bit more ice. Garnish with orange segments (optional).</li>
                    <li>Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator for up to 48 hours, though best when fresh.</li>
                </ol>
