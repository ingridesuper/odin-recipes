        <p>You can not go wrong with comforting potatoes, but Spanish patatas bravas takes fried potatoes to the next level, thanks to spicy red bravas sauce.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ingredients
                <ul>
                    <li>¾ teaspoon baking soda</li>
                    <li>4 to 5 Russet potatoes, about 2 pounds, peeled and cut into large 2-inch chunks</li>
                    <li>Kosher salt</li>
                    <li>Extra virgin olive oil, or a healthy natural cooking oil of your choice</li>\
                    <li>1 Homemade Bravas Sauce Recipe</li>
                    <li>1 Garlic aioli of your choice, store-bought is fine, optional</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Steps
                <ol>
                    <li>Fill a medium saucepan with water and bring it to a boil.</li>
                    <li>As soon as the water boils, add the baking soda (it will foam a little). Carefully add the potatoes and allow the water to come to a boil. Boil the potatoes for about 1 to 2 minutes (no longer). Drain the potatoes well in a colander.</li>
                    <li>Transfer the potatoes to a large sheet pan and season them well with kosher salt. Toss to make sure the salt is well distributed, then be sure to spread the potatoes in one single layer.</li>
                    <li>Set the potatoes aside or transfer to the fridge to cool completely (you can do this ahead of time and leave the potatoes in the fridge overnight, but it’s important for them to cool completely).</li>
                    <li>In a medium skillet, heat 1 cup of the oil over medium-high heat. When the oil begins to bubble gently, add one piece of potato to test, if the oil around it bubbles a lot, it is ready. Add the rest of the potatoes and spread them out well. You may need to do this in batches so as to not crowd the pan. Cook in the oil, tossing occasionally and making sure the potatoes are well-coated in the oil, until they are golden brown on all sides, about 20 to 25 minutes. Watch them carefully, as they can go from perfectly cooked to burned in a short time.</li>
                    <li>While the potatoes are cooking, work on the bravas sauce (if you did not make it ahead of time).</li>
                    <li>Using a slotted spoon, transfer the potatoes to a tray lined with paper towels to drain excess oil. Immediately season with another pinch of kosher salt.</li>
                    <li>Finish with a good drizzle of bravas sauce and aioli of your choice (if using). Serve immediately with more bravas sauce to the side.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
